Welcome to my space on the internet. I'm a Cloud Platforms Engineer at ANZ Plus, with a background in full-stack software engineering, DevOps, and applied machine learning. This blog documents what I'm building, breaking, and learning along the way‚Äîboth professionally and experimentally.

## üîß What I Do

I'm currently focused on:

- Designing CI/CD patterns and infrastructure for cloud-native apps at scale.
- Building with Terraform, GCP, and container platforms (Cloud Run, GKE, Istio).
- Architecting cloud migration blueprints and internal developer platforms.
- Exploring reinforcement learning, NLP, and real-time systems as side interests.
