Welcome to my space on the internet. I'm a Cloud Platforms Engineer at ANZ Plus, with a background in full-stack software engineering, DevOps, and applied machine learning. This blog documents what I'm building, breaking, and learning along the way—both professionally and experimentally.

## What I Do

I'm currently focused on:

- Designing CI/CD patterns and infrastructure for cloud-native apps at scale.
- Building with Terraform, GCP, and container platforms (Cloud Run, GKE, Istio).
- Architecting cloud migration blueprints and internal developer platforms.
- Exploring reinforcement learning, NLP, and real-time systems as side interests.

## Work & Background

- **Cloud Platforms Engineer**, ANZ Plus  
  Leading internal platform engineering efforts with a focus on developer efficiency and scalable infrastructure.

- **Solutions Architect**, Cloud Centre of Excellence  
  Designed secure, performant cloud migrations across ANZ's portfolio.

- **Research Assistant**, Deakin University  
  Worked on deep learning pipelines for information extraction and NLP.

- **Education**:  
  Bachelor of Software Engineering (First Class Honours), Deakin University  
  Academic research focused on combinatorial algorithms and applied ML.

## Certifications

- AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional
- AWS Certified Developer / Architect – Associate
- GCP Associate Cloud Engineer

## Projects & Experiments

- **5G Network Resource Optimization with Knative**  
  Simulated virtual 5G networks and optimized function deployments using Knative autoscaling.

- **Reinforcement Learning for 5G Slicing**  
  Built learning models to dynamically manage network slice resources.

- **Exact Cover Algorithms with ZDDs**  
  Researched data structures and algorithms for solving NP-complete problems in C++ and Python.

You’ll find deeper technical write-ups for these in the blog soon.
